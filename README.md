# OSSGame: A Semester-Long Study of AI

### What is this?
This game is the end product of a semester-long independent study (Olin Self Study, or OSS) in computer science topics, particularly **Artificial Intelligence**. It's currently a work in progress.

### Objectives
My intention was to create an entertaining game that comprises of several different games. These other games include Go Fish, Battleship, and Tic Tac Toe. The overarching game will be a Tamagotchi-like game, in which the player must take care of a "pet" by playing games with it. Unlike Tamagotchis, though, the "pet" has a mind of its own and can easily keep up with the player in each game.

### References and Acknowledgements
A warm and appreciative "thank you" goes to my OSS advisor and professor, Oliver Steele. Another grateful "thank you" goes to my OSS peer, Dakota Nelson. Many more "thank you"s go to the authors of the following sites, which I referenced frequently to complete this game:
* [Tic Tac Toe: Understanding the Minimax Algorithm](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax "Tic Tac Toe: Understanding the Minimax Algorithm"): A meticulous and comprehensive guide to the minimax search algorithm, especially for application to Tic-Tac-Toe. 10/10, would recommend.
* [Battleship Algorithms](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/index.html "Battleship Algorithms"): A guide to algorithms for playing Battleship. Even includes a completely new algorithm that the author appears to have come up with independently, which drastically decreases the number of turns taken per game. Very cool!
* And more to come...

### Aspirations
I want this game to be entertaining and beautiful - the kind of game that a lot of people might want to play for a significant amount of time. My plan for the gameplay is that a player will first see a Menu screen, where they can choose to start a new game or load an old one (how games will be saved is something I still need to figure out). Starting a new game will bring the player to another screen, where their "pet" will be. Every few minutes, the "pet" will ask the player to play a random game. If the "pet" wins the game, it will gain 1x the experience points associated with the game, and if the player wins, it will gain 2x the experience points (because regardless of what it is, we learn more by losing than by winning). Once the "pet" has gained enough experience points, it will "evolve" and the game will end. There are a lot of details I think I'm not considering, but I'm sure I'll be able to figure them out when I start writing the game.

In addition, I realize that Java is less conducive to game development than some other languages, but I ultimately decided to pursue the games in Java anyway because I need to be able to use Java proficiently in the summer. Besides, Java GUIs are a confusing and amazing mess that I'd like to master eventually.

### Semester Schedule
**Week of Feb. 13**: Write rough but playable drafts of a simple game to toy with ideas  
**February 20**: Pick one game idea and go deeper - implement AI (search, reaction mechanism, etc.) so that game can be played against computer  
**February 27**: Pick another game idea and write more rough drafts of it  
**March 6**: Go deeper on latest game  
**March 13**: Spring break; if I'm behind at this point, I'll catch up during the break, but if not, I'll continue developing the game  
**March 20**: Write more rough drafts of a third game  
**March 27**: Go deeper with newest game  
**April 3**: Continue developing all three games  
**April 10**: Insert both games into the overarching game  
**April 17**: Continue developing final game (and inner games)  
**April 24**: Put final touches on the game and get it ready for submission/Olin Expo  
**May 1**: Final week - final project completion and submission!

### Other Things I Should Explain But Will Do So Later
- what do we want it to look like?
- what do we want it to do?
* watching ais playing each other would be fun
* explanation of different algorithms
(pros and cons, what are they)
